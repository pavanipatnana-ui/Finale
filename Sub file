Here’s a simple paragraph about web applications:

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a web browser using the internet. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web apps do not need to be installed on a computer; instead, they are available online anytime and anywhere. Examples include online banking systems, e-commerce websites, email services, and social media platforms. Web applications are popular because they are easy to use, platform-independent, and can be updated or maintained centrally without requiring changes on users’ devices.
